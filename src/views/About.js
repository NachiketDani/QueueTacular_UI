                Queue-Tacular is a general purpose queue management app for
                businesses of all shapes and sizes. Inspired by the needs of
                local business to strictly manage capacities during the Covid-19
                pandemic of 2020, Danielle Mallare-Dani, Tim Gao, Nachiket Dani,
                and Zack Katancik set out to create a queue management
                technology designed with all business in mind, not just
                restaurants.
